Hello guys and gals,

welcome to my simple roguelike game. Your goal is to reach character 'P', which stands for **Portal**. On your way you will face **Goblins** 'G', **Goblin King** 'K', you will take risk walking into **'?'** (or perhaps you won't?) and beware of **Flame** '!', it moves and will kill you instantly. 

The game uses 2d array to load map from .txt file. It only has one level, but you can create your own, by simply changing the txt file. Just remember that '#' is your wall. I used this project to get myself familiar with OOP and working with files. All input is greatly appreciated.

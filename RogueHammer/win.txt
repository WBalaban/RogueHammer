You see a portal in front of you.
There is no turning back now.
There is nothing left behind.
You avenged your brothers.
You reclaimed your freedom.
The goblin king is dead. 
But the war is not over yet.
Mark your weapon with the blood of your enemies.
Purge the world from heresy.
For Sigmar!
*You go throught the portal...
